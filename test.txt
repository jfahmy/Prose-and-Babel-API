ENDLINE How long will I wait before downloading Tinder in Seattle? ENDLINE I may be the worst bike rider on the streets of Seattle but God help me I am NOT ashamed! ENDLINE Hiiiiiii. Just moved to Seattle and already decided I‚Äôm way irritated by the presence of any male bathroom. ENDLINE To date the man I want I must first become the man I want. This means wearing prohibitively expensive jeans and burgundy Italian loafers, I think. ENDLINE My worst nightmare would probably be dating a guy that really loves golfing. ENDLINE Arrived in Deadwood, South Dakota. Staying in a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù hotel. Aaaand the lights in the hallway keep flickering. ?

AND ummm queues are shifty and stacks are poppy üíï#100DaysOfCode? ENDLINE R2D2 #100DaysOfCode Still wrestling with the concept of binary trees. I've written and tested a Ruby script that builds the tree from a given array, so far so good. ENDLINE R2D1 #100DaysOfCode Starting round two - Doubling down on coding. I've been slacking!
